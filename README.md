## Overview
Super simple worked example of using a javascript function to filter an array before giving it to the combobox. 

The parts modified are here
![setup](docs/png/setup.png)

The Javascript code is here
```javascript
(function (TcHmi) {

    var FilterCombo = function (data) {

        console.log(data); // just to show what is being passed in.     

        function isGreaterThanZero(element) {
            return element.value > 0;
        }

        return data.filter(isGreaterThanZero);

    };
    
    TcHmi.Functions.registerFunction('FilterCombo', FilterCombo);
})(TcHmi);
```

The PLC code was modified to contain 8 elements with the last 3 using zero as the value.
